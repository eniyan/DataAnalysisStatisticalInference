# The object <cdc> is a data matrix, with each row representing a case, and each column representing a variable. R calls this data format a data frame

# Variables? Cases?


# To see what kind of data your data frame contains, you can use the names function in R. This function returns a vector of variable names in which each name corresponds to a question that was asked in the survey

# Print the names of the variables:
names(<your_data_frame>)
  displays the variables
dim(<your_data_frame>)
  displays the number of cases and variables

#You can have a look at the first or last few entries (rows) of your data frame with the commands head and tail, respectively.
head(<your_data_frame>)
tail(<your_data_frame>)


# View the head or tail of variables:
head (<your_data_frame>$<variable1>)  
tail (<your_data_frame>$<variable1>)
head (cdc$height)


#The function summary returns a numerical summary: minimum, first quartile, median, mean, third quartile, and maximum.
mean (cdc$weight)
var (cdc$weight)
median(cdc$weight)
summary(cdc$weight)


#The function table counts the number of times each kind of category occurs in a variable

#To create the "frequency table":
table(cdc$genhlth)

#you can get the relative frequencies by dividing the table by the amount of observations in your data frame
table(cdc$genhlth)/2000


#Barplot
barplot(table(cdc$smoke100))


#MosaicPlot Eg.
gender_smokers = table(cdc$gender, cdc$smoke100)
gender_smokers
mosaicplot(gender_smokers)


#It was mentioned that R stores data in data frames, which you might think of as a type of spreadsheet. Each row is a different observation (a different respondent) and each column is a different variable

# Create the subsets:
height_1337 = cdc[1337, 5]
weight_111 = cdc [111,6]

first8 = cdc[1:8, 3:5]
wt_gen_10_20 =cdc[10:20,6:9]
